			<h3>Git Flow Branch Types</h3>
			<p>There are 5 branch types in Git Flow. They are as follows.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Master:</strong> This branch is the base branch.  This branch is intended for complete, working, and launch ready code. This is the final destination for files/code.</li> <br>
				<li><strong>Feature:</strong> This branch is usually the most basic branch. It is where individual features are developed/worked on before being implemented with the rest of the site.
						Typically is an individual ticket to be worked on that is then merged with other files that create a more fully fleshed out feature.</li> <br>
				<li><strong>Develop/Sprint:</strong> This is the branch that feature branches are merged to when ready. This is a conglomeration of multiple files/tickets that work together to
						produce a working feature on a site. Feature branches are only merged here when they are fully functional.</li> <br>
				<li><strong>Sprint-release:</strong> This branch is where the various sprint conglomerations are merged together to produce the actual site. This branch is the test branch used to ensure
						that the site is functioning as designed and ready for launch.</li> <br>
				<li><strong>Patch/Hot-fix:</strong> This branch is used to manage small site issues/problems. It is branched off of the master branch and merged right back to it when ready.</li>
			</ul>

<!--In an html document, identify and describe the 5 types of branches that are part of Git Flow. Describe how the work for one ticket would move through the various branches, and when those branches would be merged.-->
<!--On many projects, developers use small snippets of code called patch files. These files outline small differences between one version of a file and another version. Create a text file, then, using git, create a patch file that adds the phrase "I'm getting the hang of this git stuff." to a file in your snap challenge by running git apply my-patch.patch. Hint: You should not actually commit the writing you are adding with my-patch.patch or the patch will fail!-->
