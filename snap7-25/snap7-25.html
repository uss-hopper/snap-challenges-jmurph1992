			<h3>Git Flow Branch Types</h3>
			<p>There are 5 branch types in Git Flow. They are as follows.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Master:</strong> This branch is the base branch.  This branch is intended for complete, working, and launch ready code. This is the final destination for files/code.</li> <br>
				<li><strong>Feature:</strong> This branch is usually the most basic branch. It is where individual features are developed/worked on before being implemented with the rest of the site.
						Typically is an individual ticket to be worked on that is then merged with other files that create a more fully fleshed out feature.</li> <br>
				<li><strong>Develop/Sprint:</strong> This is the branch that feature branches are merged to when ready. This is a conglomeration of multiple files/tickets that work together to
						produce a working feature on a site. Feature branches are only merged here when they are fully functional.</li> <br>
				<li><strong>Sprint-release:</strong> This branch is where the various sprint conglomerations are merged together to produce the actual site. This branch is the test branch used to ensure
						that the site is functioning as designed and ready for launch.</li> <br>
				<li><strong>Patch/Hot-fix:</strong> This branch is used to manage small site issues/problems. It is branched off of the master branch and merged right back to it when ready.</li>
			</ul>
